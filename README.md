# ZEMAX-mlmf-trMC

The ojective of these Monte Carlo codes is to simluate fluorescence emission and propagation in turbid media like biological tissues. In particular, the codes are compatible with the ZEMAX non-sequential mode. When combined with ZEMAX ray-tracing, one can model a full path of flurescence excitation, emission and detection through optics system and biological tissue sample. 

These codes have been modified from the MC codes written by Karhtik Vishwanath, which was created to model a fluorescent lifetime in a multi-layred turbid media containing multi-fluorophores. The modified codes here have been verified against the standard MC codes and their application has been showcased in assessing the performance of a depth-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Further detailed explantation about how the codes work and their validation results are reported in the manuscript "Ray-Traced Monte Carlo Simulation for Fluorescence Measurement in Turbid Media", which will be available once published.
