# Hybrid Monte Carlo simulation with geometrical ray tracing (hMC-GRT)

Objective of this Monte Carlo code is to simluate fluorescence emission and propagation in turbid media like biological tissues. In particular, the code is compatible with a commerical ray tracing software, ZEMAX (Currently, OpticsStudio). When combined with ZEMAX ray-tracing non-sequential mode, one can model a full path of excitation beam propagation, and fluorescence emission and detection through optics system (ZEMAX) and biological tissue sample (mlmf-trMC). 

The MC code has been modified from the original code written by Karthik Vishwanath, which was created to model a fluorescent lifetime in a multi-layred turbid media containing multi-fluorophores. The modified code here has been verified against the standard MC code and their application has been showcased in assessing the performance of a depth-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Further detailed explanation about how the code works and their verification results are reported in the manuscript "Hybrid Ray-traced Monte Carlo Simulation with Ray Tracing for Fluorescence Measurements in Turbid Media", which will be available once published.
